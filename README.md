# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator and an empty array.  The query `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` is expected to return all documents in the collection because the condition is effectively always true.  However, it returns an empty array.

The solution provided addresses this behavior, ensuring that queries with empty `$in` arrays return all documents as intended.  This is particularly relevant for scenarios where dynamic query parameters might result in empty arrays.
